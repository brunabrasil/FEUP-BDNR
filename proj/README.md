Our prototype is a web application akin to IMDB. It allows users to search for movies, actors, and directors, as well as interact with the content by leaving comments and ratings. Users can express their preferences by liking or disliking movies, providing valuable insights that help tailor recommendations. Additionally, the prototype features a social aspect, enabling users to follow other users and view their interests through a timeline. This social component fosters community engagement and facilitates the discovery of new content based on the preferences of like-minded users.
